# Module 04: *k*-Nearest Neighbors

## Overview
The k-Nearest neighbor method is a type of instance based learning that uses existing data, with known labels, to predict the label for a new observation. The purpose of this exercise is to demonstrate the use of k-NN for classification using the [iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). 


## Instructions

#### Use the notebook: `k-NN.ipynb` to perform the following :
- Question 1 — Perform the k-nn analysis using different values of k. Recommend which value is more appropriate and justify your response.
- Question 2 — Evaluate the accuracy of the results, using the best value of k.

Upload a 1-page word document to blackboard with your answers. You may use tables, graphs and charts in your explanation. **Do not submit any code**

**If you have any questions about the assignment, create a GitHub issue and `@mention` the instructor.**
